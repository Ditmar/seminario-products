Check the code for the feature to do the changes, all changes will be passed to a pull request (pr) and pass the code review to merging to the master branch
If you work alone, you need to create a branch with you username example, in my case, my user name is Ditmar
then, I choose the feature WEBSITES-1001, so the name of the branch I will need to create should be WEBSITES-1001-ditmar.
If you work in a group, you have to do a similar task with the name of the group.
